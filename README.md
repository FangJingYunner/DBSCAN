# How to use  
  
# Results
Clustering performance was tesed via clustering-benchmark dataset and real-world dataset.  
  
## benchmark dataset  
Artificial dataset was used to test clustering algorithm which can be obtained [here](https://github.com/deric/clustering-benchmark). Following parameters were used:
